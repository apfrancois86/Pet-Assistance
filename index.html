          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Michele. I had my first dog, Kisha, when I was 8 years old and from then on we were best friends. My foundation working with dogs comes from Kisha and the knowledge my mom taught me about making her a well behaved, happy, and healthy dog. Pairing my love for animals with my interest in science I went into the veterinary field after college. Iâ€™ve returned to my hometown in Portland and I am excited to meet the many pets and their families in the community!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience">
          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>My experience includes interning at a wildcat sanctuary, volunteering at shelters, and serving as the lead technician in a private veterinary practice. As a technician I formed relationships with clients and helped them care for their pets outside of the hospital. This included pet sitting, dog walling, dog bathing, dog training, nail trimming, and coaching for owners who have lots of questions about what is best for their pet. I have found that many owners benefit from education about various products, exercise/weight management, or supplements/medications available that may help their pet.</p>

          <h2>Testimonials</h2>
          <p>"I hired Michelle to help me with Brazil, a rescue GSD, that was stressed out and quite a handful. Michelle approached our case with a lot of care and forethought and made sure she put Brazil at ease before asking anything of him. She gave him very simple but important tasks that set him up for success each session."<br><i>Molly- Oakland, CA</i> </p>
          <p>"I'd like to highly recommend Michele as an in home pet sitter. She was always very professional and knowledgeable. Michele thoughtfully answered my texts when I wrote to check on my pets. It put my mind at ease to know they were in good hands and I was able to fully enjoy my vacation.  Michele is trustworthy, kind and loves what she does!!<br><i>Elizabeth- Oakland, CA</i>  </p>
