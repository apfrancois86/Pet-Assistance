          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Michele. I had my first dog, Kisha, when I was 8 years old and from then on we were best friends. My foundation working with dogs comes from Kisha and the knowledge my mom taught me about making her a well behaved, happy, and healthy dog. Pairing my love for animals with my interest in science I went into the veterinary field after college. Iâ€™ve returned to my hometown in Portland and I am excited to meet the many pets and their families in the community</p>

          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>My experience includes interning at a wildcat sanctuary, volunteering at shelters, and serving as the lead technician in a private veterinary practice. As a technician I formed relationships with clients and helped them care for their pets outside of the hospital. This included pet sitting, dog walling, dog bathing, dog training, nail trimming, and coaching/education for owners who have lots of questions about what is best for their pet. I have found that many owners benefit from education about various products, exercise/weight management, or supplements/medications available that may help their pet.</p>
